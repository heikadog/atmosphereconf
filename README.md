We will be building out a conference website with a handful of ATProto specific features.

For open discussion, and for those who are joining as active volunteers, please visit the [community forum](https://discourse.atprotocol.community/c/atmosphereconf/25/none).

## Conference Profile

For starters, we're going to have a custom conference profile. Attendees and speakers (and anyone else!) can login and create an extended profile. Inspired by [Discover Toronto](https://discover.toronto.inc/), we had an [initial discussion in the forum](https://discourse.atprotocol.community/t/conference-profiles/186) and are going to work on fleshing this out here with detailed issues.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a tangled repo at <https://tangled.org/@atprotocol.dev/ATmosphereConf.org> that was another start to this. We are using Railway for hosting, and it has Github integration for deploys, so we're going to use this for now and then figure out how to sync both, and primarily use tangled for issues and development.

## Adding a new theme

The site supports multiple themes (bluesky, blacksky, reddwarf, pckt). To add a new one:

1. **Copy the template** — `src/styles/themes/_template.css` → `src/styles/themes/<name>.css`, fill in your colors
2. **Import it** — add `@import "./themes/<name>.css";` in `src/styles/global.css`
3. **Register handle domains** — add a `<name>: [".yourdomain."]` entry in `src/components/profile/client-themes.ts`
4. **Add to the type** — add `"<name>"` to `ClientTheme` in `src/components/profile/client-themes.ts`
5. **Add to the toggle** — add `"<name>"` to the `THEMES` array in `src/components/shared/Header.astro`
6. **Add to the valid themes list** — add `"<name>"` to the `VALID` array in `src/layouts/Layout.astro` (this is the inline script that applies the saved theme before paint)
7. **Update dark icon logic** — if it's a dark theme, add it to the `isDark` check in `src/components/shared/Header.astro`
